title: 'The Cost of BPF Tail Calls'
description: 'For an upcoming blog post, I wanted to measure the cost of BPF tail calls. Tail calls allow you to jump from one BPF program to another. Their overhead varied a lot in recent kernels, with a first increase caused by Spectre mitigations and a decrease thanks to improvements in Linux 5.5.'
