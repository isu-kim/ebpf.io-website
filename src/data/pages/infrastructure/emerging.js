    to operate in unprivileged userspace using the same libraries and toolchains.
    It offers Uprobe and Syscall tracepoints for eBPF, with significant performance
    improvements over kernel uprobe and without requiring manual code instrumentation
    or process restarts. The runtime facilitates interprocess eBPF maps in userspace
    shared memory, and is also compatible with kernel eBPF maps, allowing for
    seamless operation with the kernel's eBPF infrastructure. It includes a
    high-performance LLVM JIT for various architectures, alongside a lightweight
    JIT for x86 and an interpreter.`,
