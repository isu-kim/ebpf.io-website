title: 'BMC: Accelerating Memcached using Safe In-kernel Caching and Pre-stack Processing'
description: 'Tomorrow, Yoann Ghigoff et al. will present their paper BMC: Accelerating Memcached using Safe In-kernel Caching and Pre-stack Processing at NSDI 2021. In this paper, the authors propose to speed up Memcached using eBPF by implementing a transparent, first-level cache at the XDP hook. Itâ€™s not everyday we see BPF being used on application protocols!'
