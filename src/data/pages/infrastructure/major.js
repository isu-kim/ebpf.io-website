    such as libbpf to prepare and load programs into the Linux kernel.
    The LLVM project also contains additional developer tools such as an

The GCC port is roughly equivalent to the LLVM eBPF support. There are some missing bits of functionality but the GCC community is working to close these gaps over time. GCC also contains eBPF binutils as well as eBPF gdb support for debugging of eBPF code that is traditionally consumed by the Linux kernel. Included as part of this is an eBPF simulator for gdb.`,
